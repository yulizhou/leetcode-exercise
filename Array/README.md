# Array

## 717. 1-bit and 2-bit Characters
We use a cursor to keep up with the start of every character (2 bits or 1 bit). If the value is 1, the current character must be a 2-bit character. So we move the cursor 2 bits. Otherwise, we move 1 bit. At the end, if the cursor is at the last element, the result is true. If the cursor is larger than the index range, the result is false.


## 724. Find Pivot Index
The basic idea is to compare the sum from the left side with the sum from the right side. How to get the right sum? By subtracting the current left sum and the cursor number from the sum of the whole array: `leftSum == rightSum - leftSum - nums[i]`.
